SlackBot goals
	
	Refactor
 
		2b. Create SlackBotV3 interface, move things to depend on the interface
		3. Create configuration module
			Move work specific information into config file
				CommandPrefix
				Admins
				IconUrl
				Commands //it will go through this list of classes that implement ICommandHandler and register these commands
				BotToken
				UserToken
			The configuration should be dynamic, so if an admin is added it will be added
			through the configuration object, which will be written out when the bot
			terminates
		
		4. Save state on termination
			This includes CommandHandlerRegistry and Configuration

		5. Create logging module

		6. Features to add
			Help
			MakeAdmin/TakeAdmin
			Chess
			Silence/Unsilence //takes a given channel, to replace Join
			Odds are
			Rock paper scissors
			Super tic-tac-toe
			Connect 4
		7. Undo - This will involve changes to ICommandHandler and ISlackBot interfaces
			Since it doesn't make any sense for some commands to be undone we will have to
			determine first if the command can be undone, before pushing it to the stack
			The stack will be either global, channel specifc or channel-user specific
